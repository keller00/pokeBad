# Readme
This game was made specifically for my laptop back in 2013.
Therefore it will run only on 1024 x 768 screen resolution.
It features save and load features, interaction with objects and working battle screen when the player enters bushes.

Things that never got finished:
*Label creation for battle screen (it works but all of the pokemons can only simple attack and nothing is displayed) 
*Item system
*More fluid movement of main character
*Work on varying screen sizes
